  The main learning objectives for this product was to learn another deployment option for databases besides heroku. About half way through the project turbo360 (our choice for deployment) stopped working due to a node.js update.
  Some of the challenges with this project was when changes had to be made from the original tutorial and having to adapt the project to continue having it in an operating form. Another challenge I had when working on this project was download time. Rather than working on the computer itself I was using a flashdrive which caused any downloads I needed to do to greatly increase in the amount of time needed. I finally decided to work on the computer itself to speed things up and to just install it onto my flashdrive once I was done.
  This project will help with future projects by being a skeleton I could use in the future or it will help remind me to always be open to resources and to have a back up plan if something were to screw up the original plan.
